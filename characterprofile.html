                    Rurik is a bastard fire Genasi and twin sister to Bjernvika a Genasi also,
                    their father Vasili like most Genasi caring little for their offspring produced by their lustful escapades. 
                    He grew up in a large city of many different types of folk and wasn't quite as racially profiled as most of his race commonly were.
                    This aside Rurik himself grew up comparatively larger than the norm of his cohorts and quickly was introduced into the martial craft.
                    A short career in the cities garrison dealing with minor incursions before Ruriks strengths as a fighter was noticed;
                    with the greater offing of coin and status he began fighting in the city's gladiatorial arena, defeating whatever the entertainment aloud.
                    Rurik's lusting for a greater challenge and more capital gain turns to monster hunting: Turning to the blood hunting guild for enhancement.
                    Now entangled in the thirst for monster blood Ruriks true journey begins...

                    Bjernvika like her twin was born a bastard child of a Genasi. She herself is an air Genasi,
                    but unlike her brother her path strayed from a relatively young age for a Genasi whom commonly live significantly longer than their human counter parts,
                    till the ripe old age of 120 years and more. Bjernvika being an air Genasi is as changeable as the weather, her modds could shift from calm to wild and
                    violent with little warning, but these storms would rarely last long but was enoughf or her mother to send her to the monestary.
                    Here she began her training as a monk, she had taken many trials over her youthful years each testing her mind, body and soul with increasing dificulty.
                    But to finally complete her training she must conquer evil in it's puerst form but is given 0 guidance or dirrection.
                    How will she discover her enlightenment? She decended from the mountain monestary and returned to the city of her birth to look for answers ro her true begining...
